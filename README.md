Reactive extensions for Bing location and mapping services

This package contains a suite of reactive extension APIs for Bing Map and Location based services: The goal of this package is providing a clean, well-defined API to help make it easier for developers to interact with Microsoft's most powerful services. These API's are built on top of the Reactive(Rx) framework, which helps manage and orcherstrate the asynchronous service calls to Bing. This Node module provides Bing service interfacing hooks for Spatial Data(whats around me), Location Search(where am I) and Navigation Directions(Take Me To). For more details on the underlying Bing Services, please visit [Bing.Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd877956.aspx).
